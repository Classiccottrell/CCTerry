    <p class="intro">Starting and shaping the TasteCretor Community has been a fulfilling experience. Telling E.D.SMITH&rsquo;s 133 year old Canadian story to the social world.</p>
    <p>When we started our 3-year relationship with E.D.SMITH they had an out of date web site and no social presence. We built and told the E.D.SMITH story with the creation of social channels, new website and seasonal cross-channel campaigns. </p>

    <p>We cultivated and branded the new online community TasteCreator. The Community  grew into the new face for the brand.</p>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>Target the millennial demographic, cultivate and create campaigns with creative and rewards that they care about.</p>

    <ul class="summery-list">
    <li>Monthly Newsletter</li>
    <li>Facebook Photo contests</li>
    <li>Seasonal sweepstakes & giveaways</li>
    <li>Google Adwords</li>
    <li>Facebook AdManager</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Cross-Channel Campaigns</h2>
    <p>The campaigns aimed to raise awareness of E.D.SMITH brand and products, increase targeted to grow engagement on Facebook, Instagram and Email while acquiring new consumer who may not have heard about the brand. Slowly we put together a Consumer database of consumer profiles.
    Below is the basic flow to over 14 seasonal campaigns we ran promoting the Tastcreator community and E.D.SMITH products and recipes. </p>
