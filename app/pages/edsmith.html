    <p class="intro">Starting and shaping the TasteCreator Community, as well as sharing E.D.SMITHâ€™s 133 year old Canadian story to the social world, has been a fulfilling experience.</p>
    <p>When we started our 3-year relationship with E.D.SMITH, their website was out of date and no social presence. We branded the new online community TasteCreator. The Community grew into the new face for the brand. We built and shared the E.D.SMITH story with the creation of social channels, new website, and seasonal cross-channel campaigns. </p>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>Target the millennial demographic, create campaigns with creative and rewards they would care about.</p>


    <h2>The Cross-Channel Campaigns</h2>
    <!-- The campaigns aimed to raise awareness of the E.D.SMITH brand and products, increase targeted to grow engagement on Facebook, Instagram and Email, while acquiring new customers who may not have heard about the brand. Slowly we put together a Consumer database of consumer profiles. -->

				<p>The #SummerFun campaign was centered around kicking off summer the E.D.SMITH way. Customers were engaged through a sweepstakes contest, compelling visuals and messaging that hit on the ideas of summer fun, vacations, picnics, and being out in the sun. On the social media front, customers were asked to share their own summer experiences via comments on posts.</p>
