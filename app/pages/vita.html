    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>To attract these consumer fans, we used retailers and team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo and video contest sites, awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly ticket giveaways, and signed adidas team merchandise.</p>

    <p>We created content calendars and media collateral for sports teams, players, and retailers to support the lifetime of our campaign site. All the entries passed through a form page that often used social authentication to make the entries easier for users.</p>

    <p>The Tagga platform mapped and grouped the user profiles for the client.</p>

    <p>Below, demonstrates the user flow used in these campaigns. Online and offline channels had unique URLs, keywords, or hashtags, that lead the consumer to a landing page, where they entered the campaign. After there was always exclusive content, coupons, and a retailer locator.</p>
