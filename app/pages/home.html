		<p class="intro">I truly enjoyed my 4 years was working with adidas and their partners: NBA, MLS, NCAA, Dick's Sporting Goods, Lids, and others.</p>

			<p>adidas wanted to identify people buying team product and were socially vocal about it. Grouping these "Engaged Fan Consumers" with their teams online and offline provided a real metric for future adidas or partners marketing.</p>
			<h2>The Plan</h2>
			<p>To attract these consumer fans we built cross-channel campaign strategies using adidas’ retailers and team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo and video contest sites, awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly ticket giveaways, and signed adidas team merchandise.</p>

			<div class="example">
				<img src="assets/work/adidas//NCAA/ncaa-twitter.png">
			</div>

			<p>We would create content calendars and media collateral for sports team, players and retailers to support the life time of our campaign site. All the entries would pass through the form page where we would often use Social Authentication to make the entries easier for users. </p>

			<p>The Tagga platform would take care of mapping the grouping of the user groups for the client.</p>
			<p>Below shows the basic flow used in these campaigns. Online and Offline channels would have unique URLs, keywords or hashtags, that lead the consumer to a landing page where they would enter after that there was always some exclusive content, coupons and a retailer locator.</p>

				<p>We created a cross-channel campaign that was deployed in-store and across digital channels. Leveraging the wildly popular <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a> we launched a video contest, "How Swingman are you?" users signed up and then submit a video using the hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram orVine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 All-inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.
