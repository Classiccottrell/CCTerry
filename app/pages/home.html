		<p class="intro">One of the most rewarding relationships over my 4 years was working with adidas and their partners: NBA, MLS, NCAA, Dick's Sporting Goods, Lids, and others.</p>

			<p>adidas wanted to identify people buying team product and were socially vocal about it. Grouping these "Engaged Fan Consumers" with their teams online and offline provided a real metric for future marketing campaigns.</p>
			<h2>The Plan</h2>
			<p> To attract these consumer fans we built cross-channel campaign strategies using adidas, retailers and the team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo & video contesting sites awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly Ticket giveaways and signed the appeal.</p>

			<p>NBA and adidas wanted to boost sales and discover the true market of the swingman jersey product line. We created a cross-channel campaign that was deployed in-store and across digital channels. Leveraging the wildly popular <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a> we launched a video contest, "How Swingman are you?" users signed up and then submit a video using the hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram orVine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 All-inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.
