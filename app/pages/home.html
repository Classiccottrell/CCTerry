			<p>NBA and adidas wanted to boost sales and discover the true market of the swingman jersey product line. </p>

				<p>We created a cross-channel campaign that was deployed in-store and across digital channels. Leveraging the wildly popular <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a> we launched a video contest, "How Swingman are you?" users signed up and then submit a video using the hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram orVine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 All-inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.
