		<small class="add-on">Role: Consept Development, Lead Design, Front End Development, User Experiance, Quality Assurance</small>

		<p class="intro">One of the most rewarding relationships over my 4 years was working with adidas and their partners: NBA, MLS, NCAA, Dick's Sporting Goods, Lids, and others.</p>
			<p>
				adidas wanted to identify people buying team product and were socially vocal about it. Grouping these "Engaged Fan Consumers" with their teams online and offline provided a real metric for future marketing campaigns.
			</p>
			<h2>The Plan</h2>
			<p> To attract these consumer fans we built cross-channel campaign strategies using adidas, retailers and the team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo & video contesting sites awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly Ticket giveaways and signed the appeal.</p>

<p>NBA and adidas wanted to boost sales and discover the true market of the swingman jersey product line. We created a cross-channel campaign that was deployed in-store and across digital channels. Leveraging the wildly popular <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a> we launched a video contest, "How Swingman are you?" users signed up and then submit a video using the hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram orVine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 All-inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.

					<p>As they are a fairly new league MLS had to compete with other professional sports team within large U.S cities. adidas and MLS wanted to see how their fan base was doing and who these individuals were.</p>

					<p>We created a content strategy the spend 2 MLS seasons with a test group of 3 different teams over two seasons.  Including in store signing, in-store displays, play tweets and fan engagement, social posts and campaign sites for photo contents to show your pride for your team and city.</p>
