    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> adidas wanted to identify people buying team product and were socially vocal about it. Grouping these "Engaged Fan Consumers" with their teams online and offline provided a real metric for future adidas or partners marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Our team created campaigns to reward the offline to online interaction through sweepstakes, contests, and giveaways. We identified which customers purchased in store and engaged with online adidas campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> 	Lead Design, Front End Development, User Experience, Quality Assurance</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>To attract these consumer fans, used adidasâ€™ retailers and team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo and video contest sites, awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly ticket giveaways, and signed adidas team merchandise.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <img src="assets/work/adidas//NCAA/ncaa-twitter.png">
    </div>

    <p>We created content calendars and media collateral for sports teams, players, and retailers to support the life time of our campaign site. All the entries passed through the form page that often use social authentication to make the entries easier for users. </p>

    <p>The Tagga platform mapped and grouped the user profiles for the client.</p>
    <p>Below, demonstrates the basic flow used in these campaigns. Online and offline channels had unique URLs, keywords, or hashtags, that lead the consumer to a landing page, where they entered the campaign. After there was always exclusive content, coupons, and a retailer locator.</p>

			<p>NBA and adidas wanted to boost sales and discover the true market of the swingman jersey product line. </p>

				<p>We created a cross-channel campaign that was deployed in-store and across digital channels, leveraging the wildly popular <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a> we launched a video contest, "How Swingman are you?" users signed up and then submit a video using the hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram orVine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 All-inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.

	<p>Different from all the other partners we had worked with through adidas NCAA campaigns were always event centered, I got to design media for Jumbotrons and stadium video boards. These channels relied on fans to text a keyword to a number. They would then be sent a link to a responsive landing page. </p>
