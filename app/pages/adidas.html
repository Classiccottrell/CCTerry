    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> adidas wanted to identify people buying team product and were socially vocal about it. Grouping these "Engaged Fan Consumers" with their teams online and offline provided a real metric for future adidas or partners marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Our team created campaigns to reward the offline to online interaction through sweepstakes, contests, and giveaways. We identified which customers purchased in store and engaged with online adidas campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> 	Lead Design, Front End Development, User Experience, Quality Assurance</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>To attract these consumer fans, used adidasâ€™ retailers and team's large social networks to promote and attract participants. We developed photo and video contest sites, awarding winners with VIP experiences, weekly ticket giveaways, and signed adidas team merchandise.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <img src="assets/work/adidas//NCAA/ncaa-twitter.png">
    </div>

    <p>We created content calendars and media collateral for sports teams, players, and retailers to support the life time of our campaign site. All the entries passed through the form page that often use social authentication to make the entries easier for users. </p>

    <p>The Tagga platform mapped and grouped the user profiles for the client.</p>
    <p>Below, demonstrates the user flow used in these campaigns. Online and offline channels had unique URLs, keywords, or hashtags, that lead the consumer to a landing page, where they entered the campaign. After there was always exclusive content, coupons, and a retailer locator.</p>

			<p>NBA and adidas wanted to boost sales and discover the true market of the swingman jersey product line. </p>

				<p>Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/i2R4Czt8MpI">Swingman commercials</a>, we launched the video contest, "How Swingman are you?". Users signed up and submitted a video using the campaign hashtag on their social channel of choice (Instagram or Vine) from their mobile device. The winner received 2 all inclusive tickets to the NBA Finals.
