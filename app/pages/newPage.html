	 					<p>The #SummerFun campaign was centered around the
	 					E.D.SMITH Branded Family and kicking-off summer the
	 					E.D.SMITH way. Customers were engaged to enter the
	 					sweepstakes through compelling visuals and messaging that
	 					hit on the ideas of summer fun, vacations, picnics and being out by the sun. On the social media front, customers were asked to share their own summer experiences via comments on posts.</p>

	 					<p>The goals of this campaign were to raise awareness of
	 					E.D.SMITH branded products, increase engagement on Facebook and acquire new consumer email addresses to build E.D.SMITH&rsquo;s subscriber list.</p>
