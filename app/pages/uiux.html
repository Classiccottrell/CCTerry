    <h1 class="client">Tagga UI&UX</h1>

      <p>The Tagga Customer Data Platform is designed to organize messy marketing data into a single, unified view of your customer.</p>

      <p>I am responsible for the development and maintaining of the software UI/UX by adding new features to the CDP through wireframes, designing and building prototypes, to create a visual road map for our front end developers.</p>

      <h2>How I Start</h2>
      <p>when i start my porsses i like to map things out with pencile and paper, review my sketches with the development team and look for ways to improve the experiance before wireframes or mock-ups</p>

      <h2>After That</h2>
      <p>Over a year ago we did a large UI branding expersise were we defined a basic color and UI style for all page. after doing the work in Illustrator and Photoshop it was easy to re-create elements in UX design. i was then able to creat real platform prototypes to communicat the new tools page pages we created.</p>

      <p>Luckaly i hav set most UI elements in stone allowing for grows on the fundimental deisgn eleemtns.</p>


      <div class="example">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="assets/platform-work/vertions.png">

      </div>
      </div>
<h2>The Design</h2>
    <p>Some time me and the dev team have diffrent ideas on what a good user experiance is /// i make a lot design vertion, fixing and shaping elemetns to what i consider good.</p>
    <p>to get my point across some time i will create quick videos to illustrat things quickly. im able to win conversations by showing my idea visual. </p>
    <p>starting the creation of key frames in the user experiance.</p>
