    <h1 class="client">Tagga UI&UX</h1>

      <p>The Tagga Customer Data Platform is designed to organize messy marketing data into a single, unified view of your customer.</p>

      <p>I am responsible for the development and maintaining of the software UI/UX by adding new features to the CDP through wireframes, designing and building prototypes, to create a visual road map for our front end developers.</p>

      <h2>How I Start</h2>
      <p>when i start my porsses i like to map things out with pencile and paper, review my sketches with the development team and look for ways to improve the experiance before wireframes or mock-ups</p>

      <p>Lets talka bout the segment export and time ui add on. Users were able to creat segements and export whole groups but we were adding in the ability to export to email clients likle campaign monitor and mail chimp.</p>

      <h2>After That</h2>
      <p>Over a year ago we did a large UI branding expersise were we defined a basic color and UI style for all page. after doing the work in Illustrator and Photoshop it was easy to re-create elements in UX design. i was then able to creat real platform prototypes to communicat the new tools page pages we created.</p>

      <p>Luckaly i hav set most UI elements in stone allowing for grows on the fundimental deisgn eleemtns.</p>


      <div class="example">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="assets/platform-work/vertions.png">

        </div>
      </div>
      </div>
<h2>The Design</h2>
    <p>Some time me and the dev team have diffrent ideas on what a good user experiance is /// i make a lot design vertion, fixing and shaping elemetns to what i consider good.</p>
    <p>to get my point across some time i will create quick videos to illustrat things quickly. im able to win conversations by showing my idea visual. </p>
    <p>starting the creation of key frames in the user experiance.</p>

    <div class="example">
          <img width="100%" src="assets/platform-work/work-ex.png">
    </div>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>clients will provid feed back of the paltform as they are using it, some times we try to take on a few problems with one Ui solution.</p>

    <h2>To get to production</h2>
    <p>After the creation of these prototypes we start to get a good sense of what the tool neds to do, i check with the dev team and we meet to make final changes to the UI.</p>
