    <p class="intro">Starting and shaping the TasteCreator Community has been a fulfilling experience. Sharing E.D.SMITH&rsquo;s 133 year old Canadian story to the social world.</p>
    <p>When we started our 3-year relationship with E.D.SMITH, their website was out of date and no social presence. We branded the new online community TasteCreator. The Community grew into the new face for the brand. We built and shared the E.D.SMITH story with the creation of social channels, new website, and seasonal cross-channel campaigns. </p>
