    <h1 class="client">Tagga UI&UX</h1>

      <p class="intro">The Tagga Customer Data Platform is designed to organize messy marketing data into a single, unified view of your customer.</p>

      <h2>Initial Steps:</h2>
      <p>Working off of user stories, I begin mapping UI elements and page layouts with pencil and paper. After brainstorming and sketching, it's time to take them to the dev team. </p>

      <p>I meet with the front end developer to share my sketches and collect feedback, before bringing it to the full team, consisting of myself, the back and front end devlopers and the CTO. Together, we review the user stories, along with my sketches, and gather the team's input before I begin designing elements digitally.</p>

      <h2>Moving to Digital:</h2>
      <p>I begin with the most obvious pages of the experience (beginning, middle and end pages). From there, I flush out the in-between details. If I don't like how my initial design is working out, I go back to sketching. And the process continues. </p>

      <p>Typical of a team work environment, we often disagree on what is the 'best' user flow. I create multiple versions, as well as, use video to demonstrate different team member's ideas on how different elements should interact with each other. We all can view what each option would look like for the user. From there, we determine the final design direction that I implement.</p>

          <h2>Final Edits:</h2>
          <p>I design any minor UI changes (ie. switching from a text search drop down to a static drop down). I develop a functional prototype in Adobe XD for the Front-end developer.</p>
