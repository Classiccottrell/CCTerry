    <p class="intro">
    The segment page identifies specific groups of consumers that are important to a brand (ie. consumers who abandon online shopping carts). Once these segments are created, the client has usable information to influence their marketing strategies.</p>

      <p>My role was to design and maintain the user interface and user experience for the segment page. This design needed to be flexible for the development road map, as the company grew and received more client feedback.</p>
  		<p>Below is a gif of the multiple versions during the design process.</p>

    <p>Below are two examples of design changes that improved the overall user experience design.</p>

    <p>I originally designed the page layout as a list of all of the segments and the user scrolled through them. This became a probelm when bigger clients had hundrds of segments and it wa tedious to scroll through them. I designed two versions to solve this problem. Version 1, displayed the page in two horizontal sections that divided the segment list from segment groups. Version 2, removed the segment list and displayed the segments in groups on a lefthand side bar. The client could then sort the segments into groups and easily scroll through them. Version 2 was the final version.</p>

      <p>As the segment page developed, the information became busy and was no longer functioning as intended. The original version below, displayed tabs that were hard to read and the summarized information was lost as different tabs were selected. I redesigned the righthand side bar to include the summarized information, regardless of what section is selected. Rather than use hard to read tabs, I used the accordian to navigate through information.</p>
