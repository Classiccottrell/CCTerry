  		The segment page identifies specific groups of consumers that are important to a brand (ie. consumers who abandon online shopping carts). Once these segments are created, the client has usable information to influence their marketing strategies.</p>

      <p>My role was to design and maintain the user interface and user experience for the segment page. This design needed to be flexible for the development road map, as the company grew and received more client feedback.</p>

  		<p>Below is a gif of the multiple versions during the design process.</p>

    <p>I originally designed the page layout as a list of all of the segments and the user scrolled through them. This became a probelm when bigger clients had hundrds of segments and it wa tedious to scroll through them. I designed two versions to solve this problem. Version 1, displayed the page in two horizontal sections that divided the segment list from segment groups. Version 2, removed the segment list and displayed the segments in groups on a lefthand side bar. The client could then sort the segments into groups and easily scroll through them. Version 2 was the final version.</p>

    </div>

    <p>As the segment page expanded, it became very busy and was no longer functioning as intended. I redesigned the righthand side bar to include high level information that is most valuable for the client. I made the other information accessable through the addition of the accordian.</p>
