				<p>The #SummerFun campaign was centered around kicking off summer the E.D.SMITH way. Customers were engaged through a sweepstakes contest, compelling visuals and messaging that hit on the ideas of summer fun, vacations, picnics, and being out in the sun. On the social media front, customers were asked to share their own summer experiences via comments on posts.</p>
